# GeneticAlgorithms

### This is a simple example of how a Genetic Algorithm works.

The MostValuableBag script calculates the most efficient way to add a total as close to X as possible, out of a list smaller distinct numbers Y.

#### Example 1:
X = 10

Y = [1, 3, 4]

Solution: [3, 4, 3]

In Example 1, the script would find the smallest combination possible to get to 10. The smallest score possible is calculated based on the set of
 numbers are to the original value given and a small weighting to the size of the set to improve efficiency.
 
A similar system used for the PasswordCracker, by giving the script a word it will create a random set of letters the first generation of words and
 continue to pick out the most similar words in each generation until it gets to the last generation where it will pick out the closest word to the
  original inputted.
